            <h2>Hero, you took everything from me</h2>
            <p>Alone the "monster" sat upon his throne. his "cell" as he more aptly called it. His eyes were closed as he idly ran his clawed finger along the edge of the long empty chalice resting on the arm of said "throne". he could see them running through the halls of his hidden castle. eons past he sent his minions away, his powerful followers scattered or killed by his own hand.
