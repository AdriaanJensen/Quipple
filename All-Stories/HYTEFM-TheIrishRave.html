            <h2>Hero, You took everything from me</h2>
            <p>"You've done it, hero. " Blood dribbles down the slits in the black iron helmet, dripping away from the chin to patter on the sword lodged in the chest of the hulking armored figure. "Hero, you took everything from me." </p>

            <p>In the silence the hero sneers triumphantly at his hated foe. "Your reign of madness and tyranny is over, Villain. We are victorious and your evil shall no longer taint these lands." </p>

            <p>The dark throne room is filled with the burbling laughter wheezing from the dark recesses of the shadowy helm, spurts of blood thrown out with each giggling gasp. "So sure of your own inherent goodness. Ah, to be so ignorant..." the villain murmurs.</p>
            
            <p>The Hero's sneer turns to a grimace of irritation, "Give up Villain, your de-"</p>
                    
            <p>"Defeated!? My armies are routed, scattered! My advisors are dead, slain by your hand! My lands now burn, my people are dead or dying!`` The Villain's eyes blaze crimson balls of fire from within the shadows of the helmet, his voice stronger than before, the blood cascades from the helmet and runs down the chest plate in a ruby waterfall. One gauntleted arm sweeps out at the open balcony, gesturing to the vision of hell outside, the orchestra of suffering and bloodshed clear and booming even from the throne room high above the now burning city. "All is lost." There's a flash of emerald. </p>

            <p>"WE HAD WANTED NO PART OF YOUR EMPIRE, 'HERO'. WE WISHED TO BE LEFT ALONE! WE HAD NO ARMY, WE HAD NO CAUSE TO FIGHT! WHY!? WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS TO US!?" </p>

            <p>The hero is thrown back, crashing into the throne behind him. Now slumped in this chair fashioned from dark oak he beholds the black-armored king. The king rises to his feet, his blood bright red running in a river from the sword impaled into his chest. Runes in sickly green light up all along the armor, and a ritual circle inscribes itself at the king's feet in his own blood. Turning to the limp and staring figure on the throne the king speaks: "Why, oh 'hero'? Why have you visited this misery and unjust suffering upon the people of my kingdom? Why must you kill loving fathers? Why must you rape weeping mothers? Why must you smother wailing children? Why? " The king's voice is now strong, yet quiet and sad, like a child who has been punished but does not know why. Somehow, the hero is able to find his voice, with a wavering voice he answers, "w-we had no choice! The Church summoned us to fight your evil! You are heretics and blasphemers! Pure Evil incarnate! Your country must be destroyed to save all of us...."</p>

            <p>There is a deep, uncomfortable silence. Then the Villain speaks. </p>

            <p>"If the Gods have condemned us. Then I renounce them." Turning away from the hero slumped on the broken throne, the Villain raises his arms to the sky, his voice is legion. "You came here looking to fight a monster, an excuse for all the misery and suffering you have brought on such innocent people. You have laid waste to it all and left nothing wholesome left. How well you wear the mantle of a 'hero'. So shall I now don the mantle foist upon me. You wanted a Villain, a True Monster to vanquish. Oh hero, now by your own creation be Undone. " </p>

            <p>Across the land from the highest mountains to the deepest valleys, from the kingdom's capital to the empire's vast cathedral all heard a voice uplifted by many in a choir of chaos. In this hellish declaration, the altar to the gods within the holiest of holies was sundered. And all heard the Villain's supplication.</p>

            <p>"GOD'S UPON HEAVENS HIGH! I RENOUNCE THEE! YOU HAVE SENT YOUR CHILDREN TO SLAUGHTER MINE OWN IN JEALOUS ZEALOTRY! HEAR ME! OH, YE DEVILS AND DEMONS! HEAR ME! BESTOW UPON ME YOUR TERRIBLE STRENGTH, SO THAT I MAY STRIKE BACK AT THOSE WHO HAVE WRONGED ME! Make me a creature worthy of nightmares...Make. Me. A. Monster."</p>

            <p>The skies grew dark. And a Villain was born.</p>
