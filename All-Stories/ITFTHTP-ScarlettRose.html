            <h2>It's time for the hero to pay</h2>
            <p>We won't be needed, when this is over we won't, but they'll count on one thing, even if we aren't, we'll always be there, even if they forget why we were there in the first place, because that's what we do, even if they don't appreciate it, that's what makes us different from the villains of this world. </p>

            <p>When the world turned their back on us, those who want to change the wrongs of it, choose the easier and unstable path, forgetting that true change is built upon stable principles, a hero is an unchanging current of resolve, a villain is an unstable storm, and like all storms they bring ruin, but the rivers? </p>

            <p>They bring permanent change, for the valley is not built by strong winds, but by the firm resolve of steady waters. We are an extension of those principles, you may drop it whilst you are among the living, but remember this carefully for this is true, you will never destroy it, stamp it out no matter how hard you try, you will only wither and die if you do, and if you dare to destroy everything, what's a victor without his prize?</p>

            <p>And if you wanted to, what's a victory without any witness? They say a villain only need to win once, and hero needs to keep winning, not true, we have won, we already won, for they will enviously never achieve what we have, and that is our principle, and as long as those principles live on, we won't be needed, because someone else will do our work for us, until we all die, this is the only thing that remains true, we have already won over them, because our beliefs live on, and if they try to break it, they will only be assimilated by it, or die trying to, even if they try to bring everything down, they will be washed away with like our history, and there won't be any victors, the villain loses either way.</p>
