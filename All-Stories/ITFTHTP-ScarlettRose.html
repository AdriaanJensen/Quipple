            <h2>It's time for the hero to pay</h2>
            <p>"momma why exactly do you not like the hero who saved us all?" Which caught the mother off guard at the question as she is staring at her daughter before answering "The reason I don't like this hero is simple he is a hypocrite he fights for change but nothing changed. </p>

            <p>He wanted to help us with changing our views so we aren't viewing something he didn't like but we were fine with our views we were happy with what we did but here comes someone we never met who yes he may have killed the enemy but that's it that is why he is a hero he killed someone for the betterment of the people but what the hero did was he changed our views something only a handful wanted but the rest of us didn't want to change which hurts because if we ever wanted to fix ourselves like how we had it before  we will only be shot down by those few people because they wanted to respect a man who has no clue about our history, another reason why I don't like the hero is because a hero is only a title anyone can have the title as a hero but to have the title as a warrior is something much different, one more reason before you go to bed sweetie is this a hero is just a person like you and me who have done a good deed that's all a hero is in order to do the good he does he must do stuff badly sometimes he must do some very horrible stuff to do the good deed and it annoys me how the hero can do all these horrible things only to do 1 good thing and that good deed seems to override everything he has done bad that is why I never liked the hero or more specific heros" the daughter was shocked but also thinking about everything her mother said. "Is this why you prefer the warriors more even mommy?" The daughter ask the mother as the mother smiled fondly "Your mommy is a warrior because unlike heros a warrior follow their own code their own laws their own choices and warriors are the most respected people in the world as they face much harder challenges then heros and your mommy I married her because she is a warrior because no matter who or what she faces she will fight to protect us and she will never be swayed by anything she loves us and will always be there for us now sweetie it's time for bed the most Simplist ting I can say is a hero just has a lot to pay for" the mother kissed her daughters head as her daughter is now going to sleep as the mother is now joining her wife who is a warrior.</p>
