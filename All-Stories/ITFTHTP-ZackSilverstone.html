            <h2>It's time for the hero to pay...</h2>
            <p>"Tell me, my other half. Tell me of your journey across the land, how you faced against the evil of humanity, the very humanity you choose to protect with your every beings."</p>

            <p>"We are not EVIL! YOU made them do evil stuff you monster!"</p>

            <p>"Did I? All I did was gave them the opportunity. A small push in a certain direction. All the atrocity that THEY committed was caused by their own decision."</p>

            <p>"YOU LIE!!!"</p>

            <p>"I NEVER LIE!!!"</p>

            <p>The Demon Lord roars out, shaking the entire castle to it's foundation.</p>
            
            <p>"I never lie, for it is a shield. A shield to protect the weakness in their heart. I speak only the truth, for it is the greatest weapon to wield against YOUR kind."</p>

            <p>"I....."</p>

            <p>"Why deny it, Hero? YOU know it, and yet you hid yourself from the truth, did you not?"</p>

            <p>"... stop it..."</p>

            <p>"You fear what you have found."</p>

            <p>"... Stop it."</p>

            <p>"You fear, that what you've been fighting for..."</p>

            <p>"STOP IT!!!"</p>

            <p>"-IS A LIE!!!"</p>

            <p>The Hero runs towards the Demon Lord, and stabs the being with a single thrust of his Holy Blade. The Demon Lord coughs up blood, and yet, the smile on his face remains.</p>

            <p>"Now, you shall face the truth, no matter what you desire, my other half..."</p>

            <p>The Demon Lord grab onto the Hero's shoulders, and closes in for a tight hug, forcing the blade deeper into himself. The Hero was left trembling and speechless at the action.</p>

            <p>"-For the only reason, for you to exist, Brother, has died in your arms."</p>

            <p>The Demon Lord lets out a bloody laugh, as his lifeforce slowly being extinguished by the holy attribute of the blade.</p>

            <p>"What use, is a Hero, without a Villain?"</p>

            <p>The Demon Lord, after having his energy spent and drained, turns to ash, leaving behind the Hero in an empty throne room.</p>

            <p>The Hero, who soon fall to his knees in despair, knowing that despite winning the battle, he has lost something more precious.</p>
